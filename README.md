This project focuses on predicting the future quantity requirements of stationery items in an small scale shop. Using up to five years of historical data, I have listed the items sold each month and developed a system
to predict whether the purchased quantity will be sufficient for future months. The predictions are categorized as high, medium, or low. Various algorithms have been applied to ensure accurate and
reliable predictions.
I have come to conclusion from various performance matrix and accuracy that random forest is an good algorithm for my project  

I have used Spyder to run this code as it gives neat CSV data display 
future enhancement:
u can try to deploy it in cloud and use real time data for the prediction
